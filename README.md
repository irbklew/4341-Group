You can use github through the website or locally on your computer. 

If you want to do it locally you need to download git on your computer from https://git-scm.com/downloads

Then you will need to clone the repository onto your computer. There are instructions on how to do that here https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository

Also make sure to change to the repsoitories directory after this step (cd .../4341-Group)

Then after you finish making changes to anything you will need to type the following commands to send your changes to github: 
'''
$git add .
$git commit -m "commit"
$git push
'''

To keep up to date with everyone's elses changes you need to do the following command:
'''
$git pull
'''
